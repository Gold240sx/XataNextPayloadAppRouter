// @ts-nocheck // ignores exports that are not used

// BARREL FILE for dependencies
// to import from here, use the following syntax ( route set up in tsconfig.json ):
// import { dependencyName } from "@/dependencyIndex"
// here each dependency is exported as a named export to prevent namespace collisions
// use then as normal ... dependencyName.method()
